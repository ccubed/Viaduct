# Viaduct
Viaduct is a new way to make Mu games all in Python with a multi-natured stack that is run on a backend that is disconnected from that same stack.
Each connection type is a service upon which the game is built. The game however doesn't actually exist, which sounds trippy, but allows developers and game makers to design free form clients that work however they want.
Viaduct is at its core a connection manager with an API focused on a Mu type game which uses Redis as an information store and dbus.

# License
I believe in the MIT license. It's tried, true and gets the point across without being too wordy. It boils down to: Go ahead, use it, just remember to mention me somewhere.

# Contributing
Hell yeah you can contribute. Get in there and open issues, suggestions, talk to me about features and where you want development to go. Help me code even!

# Documentation
Sphinx is great isn't it. See above for the Read the docs link.
Eventually i'll throw in some apidoc in there too.
